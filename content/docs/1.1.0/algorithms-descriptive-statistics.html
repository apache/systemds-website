<h1 id="descriptive-statistics">1. Descriptive Statistics</h1>

<p>Descriptive statistics are used to quantitatively describe the main
characteristics of the data. They provide meaningful summaries computed
over different observations or data records collected in a study. These
summaries typically form the basis of the initial data exploration as
part of a more extensive statistical analysis. Such a quantitative
analysis assumes that every variable (also known as, attribute, feature,
or column) in the data has a specific <em>level of
measurement</em> <a href="algorithms-bibliography.html">[Stevens1946]</a>.</p>

<p>The measurement level of a variable, often called as <strong>variable
type</strong>, can either be <em>scale</em> or <em>categorical</em>. A <em>scale</em>
variable represents the data measured on an interval scale or ratio
scale. Examples of scale variables include ‘Height’, ‘Weight’, ‘Salary’,
and ‘Temperature’. Scale variables are also referred to as
<em>quantitative</em> or <em>continuous</em> variables. In contrast, a <em>categorical</em>
variable has a fixed limited number of distinct values or categories.
Examples of categorical variables include ‘Gender’, ‘Region’, ‘Hair
color’, ‘Zipcode’, and ‘Level of Satisfaction’. Categorical variables
can further be classified into two types, <em>nominal</em> and <em>ordinal</em>,
depending on whether the categories in the variable can be ordered via
an intrinsic ranking. For example, there is no meaningful ranking among
distinct values in ‘Hair color’ variable, while the categories in ‘Level
of Satisfaction’ can be ranked from highly dissatisfied to highly
satisfied.</p>

<p>The input dataset for descriptive statistics is provided in the form of
a matrix, whose rows are the records (data points) and whose columns are
the features (i.e. variables). Some scripts allow this matrix to be
vertically split into two or three matrices. Descriptive statistics are
computed over the specified features (columns) in the matrix. Which
statistics are computed depends on the types of the features. It is
important to keep in mind the following caveats and restrictions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Given a finite set of data records, i.e. a <em>sample</em>, we take their
feature values and compute their <em>sample statistics</em>. These statistics
will vary from sample to sample even if the underlying distribution of
feature values remains the same. Sample statistics are accurate for the
given sample only. If the goal is to estimate the <em>distribution
statistics</em> that are parameters of the (hypothesized) underlying
distribution of the features, the corresponding sample statistics may
sometimes be used as approximations, but their accuracy will vary.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, the accuracy of the estimated distribution statistics
will be low if the number of values in the sample is small. That is, for
small samples, the computed statistics may depend on the randomness of
the individual sample values more than on the underlying distribution of
the features.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The accuracy will also be low if the sample records cannot be assumed
mutually independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), that is,
sampled at random from the same underlying distribution. In practice,
feature values in one record often depend on other features and other
records, including unknown ones.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the computed statistics will have low estimation accuracy in the
presence of extreme values (outliers) or if the underlying distribution
has heavy tails, for example obeys a power law. However, a few of the
computed statistics, such as the median and Spearman’s rank
correlation coefficient, are <em>robust</em> to outliers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some sample statistics are reported with their <em>sample standard errors</em>
in an attempt to quantify their accuracy as distribution parameter
estimators. But these sample standard errors, in turn, only estimate the
underlying distribution’s standard errors and will have low accuracy for
small or samples, outliers in samples, or heavy-tailed distributions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We assume that the quantitative (scale) feature columns do not contain
missing values, infinite values, <code>NaN</code>s, or coded non-numeric values,
unless otherwise specified. We assume that each categorical feature
column contains positive integers from 1 to the number of categories;
for ordinal features, the natural order on the integers should coincide
with the order on the categories.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="univariate-statistics">1.1. Univariate Statistics</h2>

<h3 id="description">Description</h3>

<p><em>Univariate statistics</em> are the simplest form of descriptive statistics
in data analysis. They are used to quantitatively describe the main
characteristics of each feature in the data. For a given dataset matrix,
script <code>Univar-Stats.dml</code> computes certain univariate
statistics for each feature column in the matrix. The feature type
governs the exact set of statistics computed for that feature. For
example, the statistic <em>mean</em> can only be computed on a quantitative
(scale) feature like ‘Height’ and ‘Temperature’. It does not make sense
to compute the mean of a categorical attribute like ‘Hair Color’.</p>

<p>Given an input matrix <code>X</code>, this script computes the set of all relevant
univariate statistics for each feature column <code>X[,i]</code> in <code>X</code>. The list
of statistics to be computed depends on the <em>type</em>, or <em>measurement
level</em>, of each column. The command-line argument points to a vector
containing the types of all columns. The types must be provided as per
the following convention: 1 = scale, 2 = nominal,
3 = ordinal.</p>

<p>Below we list all univariate statistics computed by script
<code>Univar-Stats.dml</code>. The statistics are collected by
relevance into several groups, namely: central tendency, dispersion,
shape, and categorical measures. The first three groups contain
statistics computed for a quantitative (also known as: numerical, scale,
or continuous) feature; the last group contains the statistics for a
categorical (either nominal or ordinal) feature.</p>

<p>Let $n$ be the number of data records (rows) with feature values. In
what follows we fix a column index <code>idx</code> and consider sample statistics
of feature column <code>X[</code>$\,$<code>,</code>$\,$<code>idx]</code>. Let

<h4 id="central-tendency-measures">Central Tendency Measures</h4>

<p>Sample statistics that describe the location of the quantitative (scale)
feature distribution, represent it with a single value.</p>

<p><strong>Mean</strong> (output row 4): The arithmetic average over a sample of a quantitative
feature. Computed as the ratio between the sum of values and the number
of values: $\left(\sum_{i=1}^n v_i\right)!/n$. Example: the mean of
sample {2.2, 3.2, 3.7, 4.4, 5.3, 5.7, 6.1, 6.4, 7.2, 7.8}
equals 5.2.</p>

<p>Note that the mean is significantly affected by extreme values in the
sample and may be misleading as a central tendency measure if the
feature varies on exponential scale. For example, the mean of {0.01,
0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 100.0} is 22.222, greater than all the sample values
except the largest.</p>

<p><strong>Median</strong> (output row 13): The &#8220;middle&#8221; value that separates the higher half of the
sample values (in a sorted order) from the lower half. To compute the
median, we sort the sample in the increasing order, preserving
duplicates: $v^s_1 \leq v^s_2 \leq \ldots \leq v^s_n$. If $n$ is odd,
the median equals $v^s_i$ where $i = (n\,{+}\,1)\,{/}\,2$, same as the
$50^{\textrm{th}}$ percentile of the sample. If $n$ is even, there are
two &#8220;middle&#8221; values <script type="math/tex">v^s_{n/2}</script> and <script type="math/tex">v^s_{n/2\,+\,1}</script>, so we compute the
median as the mean of these two values. (For even $n$ we compute the
$50^{\textrm{th}}$ percentile as $v^s_{n/2}$, not as the median.)
Example: the median of sample {2.2, 3.2, 3.7, 4.4, 5.3, 5.7, 6.1,
6.4, 7.2, 7.8} equals $(5.3\,{+}\,5.7)\,{/}\,2$ ${=}$ 5.5, see
<a href="algorithms-descriptive-statistics.html#figure1"><strong>Figure 1</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Unlike the mean, the median is not sensitive to extreme values in the
sample, i.e. it is robust to outliers. It works better as a measure of
central tendency for heavy-tailed distributions and features that vary
on exponential scale. However, the median is sensitive to small sample
size.</p>

<p><strong>Interquartile mean</strong> (output row 14): For a sample of a quantitative feature, this is
the mean of the values greater than or equal to the $1^{\textrm{st}}$
quartile and less than or equal the $3^{\textrm{rd}}$ quartile. In other
words, it is a &#8220;truncated mean&#8221; where the lowest 25$\%$ and the highest
25$\%$ of the sorted values are omitted in its computation. The two
&#8220;border values&#8221;, i.e. the $1^{\textrm{st}}$ and the $3^{\textrm{rd}}$
quartiles themselves, contribute to this mean only partially. This
measure is occasionally used as the &#8220;robust&#8221; version of the mean that is
less sensitive to the extreme values.*</p>

<p>To compute the measure, we sort the sample in the increasing order,
preserving duplicates: $v^s_1 \leq v^s_2 \leq \ldots \leq v^s_n$. We set
$j = \lceil n{/}4 \rceil$ for the $1^{\textrm{st}}$ quartile index and
$k = \lceil 3n{/}4 \rceil$ for the $3^{\textrm{rd}}$ quartile index,
then compute the following weighted mean:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\frac{1}{3{/}4 - 1{/}4} \left[
\left(\frac{j}{n} - \frac{1}{4}\right) v^s_j \,\,+ 
\sum_{j<i<k} \left(\frac{i}{n} - \frac{i\,{-}\,1}{n}\right) v^s_i 
\,\,+\,\, \left(\frac{3}{4} - \frac{k\,{-}\,1}{n}\right) v^s_k\right] %]]></script>

<p>In other words, all sample values between the $1^{\textrm{st}}$ and the
$3^{\textrm{rd}}$ quartile enter the sum with weights $2{/}n$, times
their number of duplicates, while the two quartiles themselves enter the
sum with reduced weights. The weights are proportional to the vertical
steps in the empirical distribution function of the sample, see
Figure [fig:example_quartiles] for an illustration. Example: the
interquartile mean of sample {2.2, 3.2, 3.7, 4.4, 5.3, 5.7, 6.1, 6.4,
7.2, 7.8} equals the sum
$0.1 (3.7\,{+}\,6.4) + 0.2 (4.4\,{+}\,5.3\,{+}\,5.7\,{+}\,6.1)$, which
equals 5.31.</p>

<h4 id="dispersion-measures">Dispersion Measures</h4>

<p>Statistics that describe the amount of variation or spread in a
quantitative (scale) data feature.</p>

<p><strong>Variance</strong> (output row 5): A measure of dispersion, or spread-out, of sample values
around their mean, expressed in units that are the square of those of
the feature itself. Computed as the sum of squared differences between
the values in the sample and their mean, divided by one less than the
number of values: <script type="math/tex">\sum_{i=1}^n (v_i - \bar{v})^2\,/\,(n\,{-}\,1)</script> where
$\bar{v}=\left(\sum_{i=1}^n v_i\right)/n$. Example: the variance of
sample {2.2, 3.2, 3.7, 4.4, 5.3, 5.7, 6.1, 6.4, 7.2, 7.8}
equals 3.24. Note that at least two values ($n\geq 2$) are required to
avoid division by zero. Sample variance is sensitive to outliers, even
more than the mean.</p>

<p><strong>Standard deviation</strong> (output row 6): A measure of dispersion around the mean, the
square root of variance. Computed by taking the square root of the
sample variance; see <em>Variance</em> above on computing the variance.
Example: the standard deviation of sample {2.2, 3.2, 3.7, 4.4, 5.3,
5.7, 6.1, 6.4, 7.2, 7.8} equals 1.8. At least two values are required
to avoid division by zero. Note that standard deviation is sensitive to
outliers.</p>

<p>Standard deviation is used in conjunction with the mean to determine an
interval containing a given percentage of the feature values, assuming
the normal distribution. In a large sample from a normal distribution,
around 68% of the cases fall within one standard deviation and around
95% of cases fall within two standard deviations of the mean. For
example, if the mean age is 45 with a standard deviation of 10, around
95% of the cases would be between 25 and 65 in a normal distribution.</p>

<p><strong>Coefficient of variation</strong> (output row 8): The ratio of the standard deviation to the
mean, i.e. the <em>relative</em> standard deviation, of a quantitative feature
sample. Computed by dividing the sample <em>standard deviation</em> by the
sample <em>mean</em>, see above for their computation details. Example: the
coefficient of variation for sample {2.2, 3.2, 3.7, 4.4, 5.3, 5.7,
6.1, 6.4, 7.2, 7.8} equals 1.8$\,{/}\,$5.2 ${\approx}$ 0.346.</p>

<p>This metric is used primarily with non-negative features such as
financial or population data. It is sensitive to outliers. Note: zero
mean causes division by zero, returning infinity or <code>NaN</code>. At least two
values (records) are required to compute the standard deviation.</p>

<p><strong>Minimum</strong> (output row 1): The smallest value of a quantitative sample, computed as
$\min v = v^s_1$. Example: the minimum of sample {2.2, 3.2, 3.7, 4.4,
5.3, 5.7, 6.1, 6.4, 7.2, 7.8} equals 2.2.</p>

<p><strong>Maximum</strong> (output row 2): The largest value of a quantitative sample, computed as
$\max v = v^s_n$. Example: the maximum of sample {2.2, 3.2, 3.7, 4.4,
5.3, 5.7, 6.1, 6.4, 7.2, 7.8} equals 7.8.</p>

<p><strong>Range</strong> (output row 3): The difference between the largest and the smallest value of
a quantitative sample, computed as $\max v - \min v = v^s_n - v^s_1$. It
provides information about the overall spread of the sample values.
Example: the range of sample {2.2, 3.2, 3.7, 4.4, 5.3, 5.7, 6.1, 6.4,
7.2, 7.8} equals 7.8$\,{-}\,$2.2 ${=}$ 5.6.</p>

<p><strong>Standard error of the mean</strong> (output row 7): A measure of how much the value of the
sample mean may vary from sample to sample taken from the same
(hypothesized) distribution of the feature. It helps to roughly bound
the distribution mean, i.e.the limit of the sample mean as the sample
size tends to infinity. Under certain assumptions (e.g. normality and
large sample), the difference between the distribution mean and the
sample mean is unlikely to exceed 2 standard errors.</p>

<p>The measure is computed by dividing the sample standard deviation by the
square root of the number of values $n$; see <em>standard deviation</em> for
its computation details. Ensure $n\,{\geq}\,2$ to avoid division by 0.
Example: for sample {2.2, 3.2, 3.7, 4.4, 5.3, 5.7, 6.1, 6.4, 7.2,
7.8} with the mean of 5.2 the standard error of the mean equals
1.8$\,{/}\sqrt{10}$ ${\approx}$ 0.569.</p>

<p>Note that the standard error itself is subject to sample randomness. Its
accuracy as an error estimator may be low if the sample size is small or
non-i.i.d., if there are outliers, or if the distribution has heavy tails.</p>

<h4 id="shape-measures">Shape Measures</h4>

<p>Statistics that describe the shape and symmetry of the quantitative
(scale) feature distribution estimated from a sample of its values.</p>

<p><strong>Skewness</strong> (output row 9): It measures how symmetrically the values of a feature are
spread out around the mean. A significant positive skewness implies a
longer (or fatter) right tail, i.e. feature values tend to lie farther
away from the mean on the right side. A significant negative skewness
implies a longer (or fatter) left tail. The normal distribution is
symmetric and has a skewness value of 0; however, its sample skewness is
likely to be nonzero, just close to zero. As a guideline, a skewness
value more than twice its standard error is taken to indicate a
departure from symmetry.</p>

<p>Skewness is computed as the $3^{\textrm{rd}}$ central moment divided by
the cube of the standard deviation. We estimate the
$3^{\textrm{rd}}$ central moment as the sum of cubed differences between
the values in the feature column and their sample mean, divided by the
number of values: <script type="math/tex">\sum_{i=1}^n (v_i - \bar{v})^3 / n</script> where
<script type="math/tex">\bar{v}=\left(\sum_{i=1}^n v_i\right)/n</script>. The standard deviation is
computed as described above in <em>standard deviation</em>. To avoid division
by 0, at least two different sample values are required. Example: for
sample {2.2, 3.2, 3.7, 4.4, 5.3, 5.7, 6.1, 6.4, 7.2, 7.8} with the
mean of 5.2 and the standard deviation of 1.8 skewness is estimated as
$-1.0728\,{/}\,1.8^3 \approx -0.184$. Note: skewness is sensitive to
outliers.</p>

<p><strong>Standard error in skewness</strong> (output row 11): A measure of how much the sample
skewness may vary from sample to sample, assuming that the feature is
normally distributed, which makes its distribution skewness equal 0.
Given the number $n$ of sample values, the standard error is computed as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\sqrt{\frac{6n\,(n-1)}{(n-2)(n+1)(n+3)}}</script>

<p>This measure can tell us, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the sample skewness lands within two standard errors from 0, its
positive or negative sign is non-significant, may just be accidental.</li>
  <li>If the sample skewness lands outside this interval, the feature is
unlikely to be normally distributed.</li>
</ul>

<p>At least 3 values ($n\geq 3$) are required to avoid arithmetic failure.
Note that the standard error is inaccurate if the feature distribution
is far from normal or if the number of samples is small.</p>

<p><strong>Kurtosis</strong> (output row 10): As a distribution parameter, kurtosis is a measure of the
extent to which feature values cluster around a central point. In other
words, it quantifies &#8220;peakedness&#8221; of the distribution: how tall and
sharp the central peak is relative to a standard bell curve.</p>

<p>Positive kurtosis (<em>leptokurtic</em> distribution) indicates that, relative
to a normal distribution:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Observations cluster more about the center (peak-shaped)</li>
  <li>The tails are thinner at non-extreme values</li>
  <li>The tails are thicker at extreme values</li>
</ul>

<p>Negative kurtosis (<em>platykurtic</em> distribution) indicates that, relative
to a normal distribution:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Observations cluster less about the center (box-shaped)</li>
  <li>The tails are thicker at non-extreme values</li>
  <li>The tails are thinner at extreme values</li>
</ul>

<p>Kurtosis of a normal distribution is zero; however, the sample kurtosis
(computed here) is likely to deviate from zero.</p>

<p>Sample kurtosis is computed as the $4^{\textrm{th}}$ central moment
divided by the $4^{\textrm{th}}$ power of the standard deviation,
minus 3. We estimate the $4^{\textrm{th}}$ central moment as the sum of
the $4^{\textrm{th}}$ powers of differences between the values in the
feature column and their sample mean, divided by the number of values:
<script type="math/tex">\sum_{i=1}^n (v_i - \bar{v})^4 / n</script> where
$\bar{v}=\left(\sum_{i=1}^n v_i\right)/n$. The standard deviation is
computed as described above, see <em>standard deviation</em>.</p>

<p>Note that kurtosis is sensitive to outliers, and requires at least two
different sample values. Example: for sample {2.2, 3.2, 3.7, 4.4,
5.3, 5.7, 6.1, 6.4, 7.2, 7.8} with the mean of 5.2 and the standard
deviation of 1.8, sample kurtosis equals
$16.6962\,{/}\,1.8^4 - 3 \approx -1.41$.</p>

<p><strong>Standard error in kurtosis</strong> (output row 12): A measure of how much the sample
kurtosis may vary from sample to sample, assuming that the feature is
normally distributed, which makes its distribution kurtosis equal 0.
Given the number $n$ of sample values, the standard error is computed as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\sqrt{\frac{24n\,(n-1)^2}{(n-3)(n-2)(n+3)(n+5)}}</script>

<p>This measure can tell us, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the sample kurtosis lands within two standard errors from 0, its
positive or negative sign is non-significant, may just be accidental.</li>
  <li>If the sample kurtosis lands outside this interval, the feature is
unlikely to be normally distributed.</li>
</ul>

<p>At least 4 values ($n\geq 4$) are required to avoid arithmetic failure.
Note that the standard error is inaccurate if the feature distribution
is far from normal or if the number of samples is small.</p>

<h4 id="categorical-measures">Categorical Measures</h4>

<p>Statistics that describe the sample of a categorical feature, either
nominal or ordinal. We represent all categories by integers from 1 to
the number of categories; we call these integers <em>category IDs</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Number of categories</strong> (output row 15): The maximum category ID that occurs in the
sample. Note that some categories with IDs <em>smaller</em> than this
maximum ID may have no occurrences in the sample, without reducing the
number of categories. However, any categories with IDs <em>larger</em> than the
maximum ID with no occurrences in the sample will not be counted.
Example: in sample {1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8}
the number of categories is reported as 8. Category IDs 2 and 6, which
have zero occurrences, are still counted; but if there is a category
with ID${}=9$ and zero occurrences, it is not counted.</p>

<p><strong>Mode</strong> (output row 16): The most frequently occurring category value. If several
values share the greatest frequency of occurrence, then each of them is
a mode; but here we report only the smallest of these modes. Example: in
sample {1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8} the modes are
3 and 7, with 3 reported.</p>

<p>Computed by counting the number of occurrences for each category, then
taking the smallest category ID that has the maximum count. Note that
the sample modes may be different from the distribution modes, i.e. the
categories whose (hypothesized) underlying probability is the maximum
over all categories.</p>

<p><strong>Number of modes</strong> (output row 17): The number of category values that each have the
largest frequency count in the sample. Example: in sample {1, 3, 3,
3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8} there are two category IDs (3
and 7) that occur the maximum count of 4 times; hence, we return 2.</p>

<p>Computed by counting the number of occurrences for each category, then
counting how many categories have the maximum count. Note that the
sample modes may be different from the distribution modes, i.e. the
categories whose (hypothesized) underlying probability is the maximum
over all categories.</p>

<h3 id="returns">Returns</h3>

<p>The output matrix containing all computed statistics is of size
$17$ rows and as many columns as in the input matrix <code>X</code>. Each row
corresponds to a particular statistic, according to the convention
specified in <a href="algorithms-descriptive-statistics.html#table1"><strong>Table 1</strong></a>. The first $14$ statistics are
applicable for <em>scale</em> columns, and the last $3$ statistics are
applicable for categorical, i.e. nominal and ordinal, columns.</p>

<h2 id="bivariate-statistics">1.2. Bivariate Statistics</h2>

<h3 id="description-1">Description</h3>

<p>Bivariate statistics are used to quantitatively describe the association
between two features, such as test their statistical (in-)dependence or
measure the accuracy of one data feature predicting the other feature,
in a sample. The <code>bivar-stats.dml</code> script computes common
bivariate statistics, such as Pearson’s correlation
coefficient and Pearson’s $\chi^2$, in parallel for
many pairs of data features. For a given dataset matrix, script
<code>bivar-stats.dml</code> computes certain bivariate statistics for
the given feature (column) pairs in the matrix. The feature types govern
the exact set of statistics computed for that pair. For example,
Pearson’s correlation coefficient can only be computed on
two quantitative (scale) features like ‘Height’ and ‘Temperature’. It
does not make sense to compute the linear correlation of two categorical
attributes like ‘Hair Color’.</p>

<h3 id="details-1">Details</h3>

<p>Script <code>bivar-stats.dml</code> takes an input matrix <code>X</code> whose
columns represent the features and whose rows represent the records of a
data sample. Given <code>X</code>, the script computes certain relevant bivariate
statistics for specified pairs of feature columns <code>X[,i]</code> and
<code>X[,j]</code>. Command-line parameters <code>index1</code> and <code>index2</code> specify the
files with column pairs of interest to the user. Namely, the file given
by <code>index1</code> contains the vector of the 1st-attribute column indices and
the file given by <code>index2</code> has the vector of the 2nd-attribute column
indices, with &#8220;1st&#8221; and &#8220;2nd&#8221; referring to their places in bivariate
statistics. Note that both <code>index1</code> and <code>index2</code> files should contain a
1-row matrix of positive integers.</p>

<p>The bivariate statistics to be computed depend on the <em>types</em>, or
<em>measurement levels</em>, of the two columns. The types for each pair are
provided in the files whose locations are specified by <code>types1</code> and
<code>types2</code> command-line parameters. These files are also 1-row matrices,
i.e. vectors, that list the 1st-attribute and the 2nd-attribute column
types in the same order as their indices in the <code>index1</code> and <code>index2</code>
files. The types must be provided as per the following convention:
1 = scale, 2 = nominal, 3 = ordinal.</p>

<p>The script organizes its results into (potentially) four output
matrices, one per each type combination. The types of bivariate
statistics are defined using the types of the columns that were used for
their arguments, with &#8220;ordinal&#8221; sometimes retrogressing to &#8220;nominal.&#8221;
<a href="algorithms-descriptive-statistics.html#table2"><strong>Table 2</strong></a>
describes what each column in each output matrix
contains. In particular, the script includes the following statistics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For a pair of scale (quantitative) columns, Pearson’s correlation coefficient.</li>
  <li>For a pair of nominal columns (with finite-sized, fixed, unordered
domains), the Pearson’s $\chi^2$ and its p-value.</li>
  <li>For a pair of one scale column and one nominal column, $F$ statistic.</li>
  <li>For a pair of ordinal columns (ordered domains depicting ranks),
Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that, as shown in <a href="algorithms-descriptive-statistics.html#table2"><strong>Table 2</strong></a>, the output matrices
contain the column indices of the features involved in each statistic.
Moreover, if the output matrix does not contain a value in a certain
cell then it should be interpreted as a $0$ (sparse matrix
representation).</p>

<p>Below we list all bivariate statistics computed by script
<code>bivar-stats.dml</code>. The statistics are collected into
several groups by the type of their input features. We refer to the two
input features as $v_1$ and $v_2$ unless specified otherwise; the value
pairs are <script type="math/tex">(v_{1,i}, v_{2,i})</script> for $i=1,\ldots,n$, where $n$ is the
number of rows in <code>X</code>, i.e. the sample size.</p>

<h4 id="scale-vs-scale-statistics">Scale-vs-Scale Statistics</h4>

<p>Sample statistics that describe association between two quantitative
(scale) features. A scale feature has numerical values, with the natural
ordering relation.</p>

<p><em>Pearson’s correlation coefficient</em>: A measure of linear
dependence between two numerical features:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">r
= \frac{Cov(v_1, v_2)}{\sqrt{Var v_1 Var v_2}}
= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (v_{1,i} - \bar{v}_1) (v_{2,i} - \bar{v}_2)}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (v_{1,i} - \bar{v}_1)^{2\mathstrut} \cdot \sum_{i=1}^n (v_{2,i} - \bar{v}_2)^{2\mathstrut}}}</script>

<p>Commonly denoted by $r$, correlation ranges between $-1$ and $+1$,
reaching ${\pm}1$ when all value pairs <script type="math/tex">(v_{1,i}, v_{2,i})</script> lie on the
same line. Correlation near 0 means that a line is not a good way to
represent the dependence between the two features; however, this does
not imply independence. The sign indicates direction of the linear
association: $r &gt; 0$ ($r &lt; 0$) if one feature tends to linearly increase
(decrease) when the other feature increases. Nonlinear association, if
present, may disobey this sign. Pearson’s correlation
coefficient is symmetric: $r(v_1, v_2) = r(v_2, v_1)$; it does
not change if we transform $v_1$ and $v_2$ to $a + b v_1$ and
$c + d v_2$ where $a, b, c, d$ are constants and $b, d &gt; 0$.</p>

<p>Suppose that we use simple linear regression to represent one feature
given the other, say represent <script type="math/tex">v_{2,i} \approx \alpha + \beta v_{1,i}</script>
by selecting $\alpha$ and $\beta$ to minimize the least-squares error
<script type="math/tex">\sum_{i=1}^n (v_{2,i} - \alpha - \beta v_{1,i})^2</script>. Then the best error
equals</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\min_{\alpha, \beta} \,\,\sum_{i=1}^n \big(v_{2,i} - \alpha - \beta v_{1,i}\big)^2 \,\,=\,\,
(1 - r^2) \,\sum_{i=1}^n \big(v_{2,i} - \bar{v}_2\big)^2</script>

<p>In other words, $1\,{-}\,r^2$ is the ratio of the residual sum of squares to the
total sum of squares. Hence, $r^2$ is an accuracy measure of the linear
regression.</p>

<h4 id="nominal-vs-nominal-statistics">Nominal-vs-Nominal Statistics</h4>

<p>Sample statistics that describe association between two nominal
categorical features. Both features’ value domains are encoded with
positive integers in arbitrary order: nominal features do not order
their value domains.</p>

<p><em>Pearson’s $\chi^2$</em>: A measure of how much the
frequencies of value pairs of two categorical features deviate from
statistical independence. Under independence, the probability of every
value pair must equal the product of probabilities of each value in the
pair: $Prob[a, b] - Prob[a]Prob[b] = 0$.
But we do not know these (hypothesized) probabilities; we only know the
sample frequency counts. Let $n_{a,b}$ be the frequency count of pair
$(a, b)$, let $n_a$ and $n_b$ be the frequency counts of $a$ alone and
of $b$ alone. Under independence, difference
<script type="math/tex">n_{a,b}{/}n - (n_a{/}n)(n_b{/}n)</script> is unlikely to be exactly 0 due to
sample randomness, yet it is unlikely to be too far from 0. For some
pairs $(a,b)$ it may deviate from 0 farther than for other pairs.
Pearson’s $\chi^2$ is an aggregate measure that combines
squares of these differences across all value pairs:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\chi^2 \,\,=\,\, \sum_{a,\,b} \Big(\frac{n_a n_b}{n}\Big)^{-1} \Big(n_{a,b} - \frac{n_a n_b}{n}\Big)^2
\,=\,\, \sum_{a,\,b} \frac{(O_{a,b} - E_{a,b})^2}{E_{a,b}}</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">O_{a,b} = n_{a,b}</script> are the <em>observed</em> frequencies and
$E_{a,b} = (n_a n_b){/}n$ are the <em>expected</em> frequencies for all
pairs $(a,b)$. Under independence (plus other standard assumptions) the
sample $\chi^2$ closely follows a well-known distribution, making it a
basis for statistical tests for independence,
see <em>$P\textrm{-}$value of Pearson’s $\chi^2$</em> for details.
Note that Pearson’s $\chi^2$ does <em>not</em> measure the
strength of dependence: even very weak dependence may result in a
significant deviation from independence if the counts are large enough.
Use Cramér’s $V$ instead to measure the strength of
dependence.</p>

<p><em>Degrees of freedom</em>: An integer parameter required for the
interpretation of Pearson’s $\chi^2$ measure. Under
independence (plus other standard assumptions) the sample $\chi^2$
statistic is approximately distributed as the sum of $d$ squares of
independent normal random variables with mean 0 and variance 1, where
$d$ is this integer parameter. For a pair of categorical features such
that the $1^{\textrm{st}}$ feature has $k_1$ categories and the
$2^{\textrm{nd}}$ feature has $k_2$ categories, the number of degrees of
freedom is $d = (k_1 - 1)(k_2 - 1)$.</p>

<p><em>$P\textrm{-}$value of Pearson’s $\chi^2$</em>: A measure of
how likely we would observe the current frequencies of value pairs of
two categorical features assuming their statistical independence. More
precisely, it computes the probability that the sum of $d$ squares of
independent normal random variables with mean 0 and variance 1 (called
the $\chi^2$ distribution with $d$ degrees of freedom) generates a value
at least as large as the current sample Pearson’s $\chi^2$.
The $d$ parameter is <em>degrees of freedom</em>, see above. Under independence
(plus other standard assumptions) the sample
Pearson’s $\chi^2$ closely follows the
$\chi^2$ distribution and is unlikely to land very far into its tail. On
the other hand, if the two features are dependent, their sample
Pearson’s $\chi^2$ becomes arbitrarily large as
$n\to\infty$ and lands extremely far into the tail of the
$\chi^2$ distribution given a large enough data sample.
$P\textrm{-}$value of Pearson’s $\chi^2$ returns the tail
&#8220;weight&#8221; on the right-hand side of Pearson’s $\chi^2$:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P = Prob\big[r \geq \textrm{Pearson’s $\chi^2$} \big|\,\, r \sim \textrm{the $\chi^2$ distribution}\big]</script>

<p>As any probability, $P$ ranges between 0 and 1. If $P\leq 0.05$, the
dependence between the two features may be considered statistically
significant (i.e. their independence is considered statistically ruled
out). For highly dependent features, it is not unusual to have
$P\leq 10^{-20}$ or less, in which case our script will simply return
$P = 0$. Independent features should have their $P\geq 0.05$ in about
95% cases.</p>

<p><em>Cramér’s $V$</em>: A measure for the strength of
association, i.e. of statistical dependence, between two categorical
features, conceptually similar to Pearson’s correlation
coefficient. It divides the
observed Pearson’s $\chi^2$ by the maximum
possible $\chi^2_{\textrm{max}}$ given $n$ and the number $k_1, k_2$ of
categories in each feature, then takes the square root. Thus,
Cramér’s $V$ ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 implies no
association and 1 implies the maximum possible association (one-to-one
correspondence) between the two features. See
<em>Pearson’s $\chi^2$</em> for the computation of $\chi^2$; its
maximum = $n\cdot\min\{k_1\,{-}\,1, k_2\,{-}\,1\}$ where the
$1^{\textrm{st}}$ feature has $k_1$ categories and the
$2^{\textrm{nd}}$ feature has $k_2$
categories 
<a href="algorithms-bibliography.html">[AcockStavig1979]</a>, so</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\textrm{Cramér’s $V$} \,\,=\,\, \sqrt{\frac{\textrm{Pearson’s $\chi^2$}}{n\cdot\min\{k_1\,{-}\,1, k_2\,{-}\,1\}}}</script>

<p>As opposed to $P\textrm{-}$value of Pearson’s $\chi^2$,
which goes to 0 (rapidly) as the features’ dependence increases,
Cramér’s $V$ goes towards 1 (slowly) as the dependence
increases. Both Pearson’s $\chi^2$ and
$P\textrm{-}$value of Pearson’s $\chi^2$ are very sensitive
to $n$, but in Cramér’s $V$ this is mitigated by taking the
ratio.</p>

<h4 id="nominal-vs-scale-statistics">Nominal-vs-Scale Statistics</h4>

<p>Sample statistics that describe association between a categorical
feature (order ignored) and a quantitative (scale) feature. The values
of the categorical feature must be coded as positive integers.</p>

<p><em>Eta statistic</em>: A measure for the strength of
association (statistical dependence) between a nominal feature and a
scale feature, conceptually similar to Pearson’s correlation
coefficient. Ranges from 0 to 1, approaching 0 when there is no
association and approaching 1 when there is a strong association. The
nominal feature, treated as the independent variable, is assumed to have
relatively few possible values, all with large frequency counts. The
scale feature is treated as the dependent variable. Denoting the nominal
feature by $x$ and the scale feature by $y$, we have:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\eta^2 \,=\, 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \big(y_i - \hat{y}[x_i]\big)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y})^2},
\,\,\,\,\textrm{where}\,\,\,\,
\hat{y}[x] = \frac{1}{\mathop{\mathrm{freq}}(x)}\sum_{i=1}^n  
\,\left\{\!\!\begin{array}{rl} y_i & \textrm{if $x_i = x$}\\ 0 & \textrm{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\!\!\! %]]></script>

<p>and <script type="math/tex">\bar{y} = (1{/}n)\sum_{i=1}^n y_i</script> is the mean. Value $\hat{y}[x]$
is the average of $y_i$ among all records where $x_i = x$; it can also
be viewed as the &#8220;predictor&#8221; of $y$ given $x$. Then
<script type="math/tex">\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}[x_i])^2</script> is the residual error
sum-of-squares and $\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y})^2$ is the total
sum-of-squares for $y$. Hence, $\eta^2$ measures the accuracy of
predicting $y$ with $x$, just like the &#8220;R-squared&#8221; statistic measures
the accuracy of linear regression. Our output $\eta$ is the square root
of $\eta^2$.</p>

<p><em>$F$ statistic</em>: A measure of how much the values of the
scale feature, denoted here by $y$, deviate from statistical
independence on the nominal feature, denoted by $x$. The same measure
appears in the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Like
Pearson’s $\chi^2$, $F$ statistic is used to
test the hypothesis that $y$ is independent from $x$, given the
following assumptions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The scale feature $y$ has approximately normal distribution whose mean
may depend only on $x$ and variance is the same for all $x$.</li>
  <li>The nominal feature $x$ has relatively small value domain with large
frequency counts, the $x_i$-values are treated as fixed (non-random).</li>
  <li>All records are sampled independently of each other.</li>
</ul>

<p>To compute $F$ statistic, we first compute $\hat{y}[x]$ as
the average of $y_i$ among all records where $x_i = x$. These
$\hat{y}[x]$ can be viewed as &#8220;predictors&#8221; of $y$ given $x$; if $y$ is
independent on $x$, they should &#8220;predict&#8221; only the global
mean $\bar{y}$. Then we form two sums-of-squares:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Residual</em> sum-of-squares of the &#8220;predictor&#8221; accuracy:
$y_i - \hat{y}[x_i]$.</li>
  <li><em>Explained</em> sum-of-squares of the &#8220;predictor&#8221; variability:
$\hat{y}[x_i] - \bar{y}$.</li>
</ul>

<p>$F$ statistic is the ratio of the explained sum-of-squares
to the residual sum-of-squares, each divided by their corresponding
degrees of freedom:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">F \,\,=\,\, 
\frac{\sum_{x}\, \mathop{\mathrm{freq}}(x) \, \big(\hat{y}[x] - \bar{y}\big)^2 \,\big/\,\, (k\,{-}\,1)}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \big(y_i - \hat{y}[x_i]\big)^2 \,\big/\,\, (n\,{-}\,k)} \,\,=\,\,
\frac{n\,{-}\,k}{k\,{-}\,1} \cdot \frac{\eta^2}{1 - \eta^2}</script>

<p>Here $k$
is the domain size of the nominal feature $x$. The $k$ &#8220;predictors&#8221; lose
1 freedom due to their linear dependence with $\bar{y}$; similarly, the
$n$ $y_i$-s lose $k$ freedoms due to the &#8220;predictors&#8221;.</p>

<p>The statistic can test if the independence hypothesis of $y$ from $x$ is
reasonable; more generally (with relaxed normality assumptions) it can
test the hypothesis that <em>the mean</em> of $y$ among records with a
given $x$ is the same for all $x$. Under this hypothesis
$F$ statistic has, or approximates, the
$F(k\,{-}\,1, n\,{-}\,k)$-distribution. But if the mean of $y$ given $x$
depends on $x$, $F$ statistic becomes arbitrarily large as
$n\to\infty$ (with $k$ fixed) and lands extremely far into the tail of
the $F(k\,{-}\,1, n\,{-}\,k)$-distribution given a large enough data
sample.</p>

<h4 id="ordinal-vs-ordinal-statistics">Ordinal-vs-Ordinal Statistics</h4>

<p>Sample statistics that describe association between two ordinal
categorical features. Both features’ value domains are encoded with
positive integers, so that the natural order of the integers coincides
with the order in each value domain.</p>

<p><em>Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient</em>: A measure for
the strength of association (statistical dependence) between two ordinal
features, conceptually similar to Pearson’s correlation
coefficient. Specifically, it is Pearson’s correlation
coefficient applied to the feature vectors in which all values
are replaced by their ranks, i.e.  their positions if the vector is
sorted. The ranks of identical (duplicate) values are replaced with
their average rank. For example, in vector $(15, 11, 26, 15, 8)$ the
value &#8220;15&#8221; occurs twice with ranks 3 and 4 per the sorted order
$(8_1, 11_2, 15_3, 15_4, 26_5)$; so, both values are assigned their
average rank of $3.5 = (3\,{+}\,4)\,{/}\,2$ and the vector is replaced
by $(3.5,\, 2,\, 5,\, 3.5,\, 1)$.</p>

<p>Our implementation of Spearman’s rank correlation
coefficient is geared towards features having small value domains
and large counts for the values. Given the two input vectors, we form a
contingency table $T$ of pairwise frequency counts, as well as a vector
of frequency counts for each feature: $f_1$ and $f_2$. Here in
<script type="math/tex">T_{i,j}</script>, <script type="math/tex">f_{1,i}</script>, <script type="math/tex">f_{2,j}</script> indices $i$ and $j$ refer to the
order-preserving integer encoding of the feature values. We use prefix
sums over $f_1$ and $f_2$ to compute the values’ average ranks:
<script type="math/tex">r_{1,i} = \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} f_{1,j} + (f_{1,i}\,{+}\,1){/}2</script>, and
analogously for $r_2$. Finally, we compute rank variances for $r_1, r_2$
weighted by counts $f_1, f_2$ and their covariance weighted by $T$,
before applying the standard formula for Pearson’s correlation
coefficient:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\rho \,\,=\,\, \frac{Cov_T(r_1, r_2)}{\sqrt{Var_{f_1}(r_1)Var_{f_2}(r_2)}}
\,\,=\,\, \frac{\sum_{i,j} T_{i,j} (r_{1,i} - \bar{r}_1) (r_{2,j} - \bar{r}_2)}{\sqrt{\sum_i f_{1,i} (r_{1,i} - \bar{r}_1)^{2\mathstrut} \cdot \sum_j f_{2,j} (r_{2,j} - \bar{r}_2)^{2\mathstrut}}}</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">\bar{r_1} = \sum_i r_{1,i} f_{1,i}{/}n</script>, analogously
for $\bar{r}_2$. The value of $\rho$ lies between $-1$ and $+1$, with
sign indicating the prevalent direction of the association: $\rho &gt; 0$
($\rho &lt; 0$) means that one feature tends to increase (decrease) when
the other feature increases. The correlation becomes 1 when the two
features are monotonically related.</p>

<h3 id="returns-1">Returns</h3>

<p>A collection of (potentially) 4 matrices. Each matrix contains bivariate
statistics that resulted from a different combination of feature types.
There is one matrix for scale-scale statistics (which includes
Pearson’s correlation coefficient), one for nominal-nominal
statistics (includes Pearson’s $\chi^2$), one for
nominal-scale statistics (includes $F$ statistic) and one
for ordinal-ordinal statistics (includes Spearman’s rank
correlation coefficient). If any of these matrices is not
produced, then no pair of columns required the corresponding type
combination. See
<a href="algorithms-descriptive-statistics.html#table2"><strong>Table 2</strong></a>
for the matrix naming and format
details.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="stratified-bivariate-statistics">1.3. Stratified Bivariate Statistics</h2>

<h3 id="description-2">Description</h3>

<p>The <code>stratstats.dml</code> script computes common bivariate
statistics, such as correlation, slope, and their p-value, in parallel
for many pairs of input variables in the presence of a confounding
categorical variable. The values of this confounding variable group the
records into strata (subpopulations), in which all bivariate pairs are
assumed free of confounding. The script uses the same data model as in
one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with strata representing
population samples. It also outputs univariate stratified and bivariate
unstratified statistics.</p>

<p>To see how data stratification mitigates confounding, consider an
(artificial) example in 
<a href="algorithms-descriptive-statistics.html#table3"><strong>Table 3</strong></a>. A highly seasonal
retail item was marketed with and without a promotion over the final
3 months of the year. In each month the sale was more likely with the
promotion than without it. But during the peak holiday season, when
shoppers came in greater numbers and bought the item more often, the
promotion was less frequently used. As a result, if the 4-th quarter
data is pooled together, the promotion’s effect becomes reversed and
magnified. Stratifying by month restores the positive correlation.</p>

<p>The script computes its statistics in parallel over all possible pairs
from two specified sets of covariates. The 1-st covariate is a column in
input matrix $X$ and the 2-nd covariate is a column in input matrix $Y$;
matrices $X$ and $Y$ may be the same or different. The columns of
interest are given by their index numbers in special matrices. The
stratum column, specified in its own matrix, is the same for all
covariate pairs.</p>

<p>Both covariates in each pair must be numerical, with the 2-nd covariate
normally distributed given the 1-st covariate (see Details). Missing
covariate values or strata are represented by &#8221;NaN&#8221;. Records with NaN’s
are selectively omitted wherever their NaN’s are material to the output
statistic.</p>

becomes reversed and amplified (from $+0.1$ to $-0.5$) if we ignore the months.</p>

<h3 id="arguments-2">Arguments</h3>

<p><strong>X</strong>: Location (on HDFS) to read matrix $X$ whose columns we want to use as
the 1-st covariate (i.e. as the feature variable)</p>

<p><strong>Xcid</strong>: (default: <code>" "</code>) Location to read the single-row matrix that lists all index
numbers of the $X$-columns used as the 1-st covariate; the default value
means &#8220;use all $X$-columns&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Y</strong>: (default: <code>" "</code>) Location to read matrix $Y$ whose columns we want to use as
the 2-nd covariate (i.e. as the response variable); the default value
means &#8220;use $X$ in place of $Y$&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Ycid</strong>: (default: <code>" "</code>) Location to read the single-row matrix that lists all index
numbers of the $Y$-columns used as the 2-nd covariate; the default value
means &#8220;use all $Y$-columns&#8221;</p>

<h3 id="details-2">Details</h3>

<p>Suppose we have $n$ records of format $(i, x, y)$, where
<script type="math/tex">i\in\{1,\ldots, k\}</script> is a stratum number and $(x, y)$ are two numerical
covariates. We want to analyze conditional linear relationship between
$y$ and $x$ conditioned by $i$. Note that $x$, but not $y$, may
represent a categorical variable if we assign a numerical value to each
category, for example 0 and 1 for two categories.</p>

<p>We assume a linear regression model for $y$:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{equation}
y_{i,j} \,=\, \alpha_i + \beta x_{i,j} + {\varepsilon}_{i,j}\,, \quad\textrm{where}\,\,\,\,
{\varepsilon}_{i,j} \sim Normal(0, \sigma^2)
\end{equation}</script>

<p>Here $i = 1\ldots k$ is a stratum number and
$j = 1\ldots n_i$ is a record number in stratum $i$; by $n_i$ we denote
the number of records available in stratum $i$. The noise
term <script type="math/tex">\varepsilon_{i,j}</script> is assumed to have the same variance in all
strata. When $n_i\,{&gt;}\,0$, we can estimate the means of <script type="math/tex">x_{i, j}</script> and
<script type="math/tex">y_{i, j}</script> in stratum $i$ as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\bar{x}_i \,= \Big(\sum\nolimits_{j=1}^{n_i} \,x_{i, j}\Big) / n_i\,;\quad
\bar{y}_i \,= \Big(\sum\nolimits_{j=1}^{n_i} \,y_{i, j}\Big) / n_i</script>

<p>If
$\beta$ is known, the best estimate for $\alpha_i$ is
$\bar{y}_i - \beta \bar{x}_i$, which gives the prediction error
sum-of-squares of</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{equation}
\sum\nolimits_{i=1}^k \sum\nolimits_{j=1}^{n_i} \big(y_{i,j} - \beta x_{i,j} - (\bar{y}_i - \beta \bar{x}_i)\big)^2
\,\,=\,\, \beta^{2\,}V_x \,-\, 2\beta \,V_{x,y} \,+\, V_y
\label{eqn:stratsumsq}
\end{equation}</script>

<p>where $V_x$, $V_y$, and $V_{x, y}$ are,
correspondingly, the &#8220;stratified&#8221; sample estimates of variance
$Var(x)$ and
$Var(y)$ and covariance
$Cov(x,y)$ computed as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{aligned}
V_x     \,&=\, \sum\nolimits_{i=1}^k \sum\nolimits_{j=1}^{n_i} \big(x_{i,j} - \bar{x}_i\big)^2; \quad
V_y     \,=\, \sum\nolimits_{i=1}^k \sum\nolimits_{j=1}^{n_i} \big(y_{i,j} - \bar{y}_i\big)^2;\\
V_{x,y} \,&=\, \sum\nolimits_{i=1}^k \sum\nolimits_{j=1}^{n_i} \big(x_{i,j} - \bar{x}_i\big)\big(y_{i,j} - \bar{y}_i\big)\end{aligned} %]]></script>

<p>They are stratified because we compute the sample (co-)variances in each
stratum $i$ separately, then combine by summation. The stratified
estimates for $Var(X)$ and
$Var(Y)$ tend to be smaller
than the non-stratified ones (with the global mean instead of
$\bar{x_i}$ and $\bar{y_i}$) since $\bar{x_i}$ and $\bar{y_i}$ fit
closer to <script type="math/tex">x_{i,j}</script> and <script type="math/tex">y_{i,j}</script> than the global means. The stratified
variance estimates the uncertainty in <script type="math/tex">x_{i,j}</script> and <script type="math/tex">y_{i,j}</script> given
their stratum $i$.</p>

<p>Minimizing over $\beta$ the error sum-of-squares (2)
gives us the regression slope estimate $\hat{\beta} = V_{x,y} / V_x$,
with (2) becoming the residual sum-of-squares (RSS):</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathrm{RSS} \,\,=\, \,
\sum\nolimits_{i=1}^k \sum\nolimits_{j=1}^{n_i} \big(y_{i,j} - 
\hat{\beta} x_{i,j} - (\bar{y}_i - \hat{\beta} \bar{x}_i)\big)^2
\,\,=\,\,  V_y \,\big(1 \,-\, V_{x,y}^2 / (V_x V_y)\big)</script>

<p>The quantity
<script type="math/tex">\hat{R}^2 = V_{x,y}^2 / (V_x V_y)</script>, called <em>$R$-squared</em>, estimates the
fraction of stratified variance in <script type="math/tex">y_{i,j}</script> explained by covariate
<script type="math/tex">x_{i, j}</script> in the linear regression model (1). We
define <em>stratified correlation</em> as the square root of $\hat{R}^2$ taken
with the sign of $V_{x,y}$. We also use RSS to estimate the residual
standard deviation $\sigma$ in (1) that models the
prediction error of <script type="math/tex">y_{i,j}</script> given <script type="math/tex">x_{i,j}</script> and the stratum:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\hat{\beta}\, =\, \frac{V_{x,y}}{V_x}; \,\,\,\, \hat{R} \,=\, \frac{V_{x,y}}{\sqrt{V_x V_y}};
\,\,\,\, \hat{R}^2 \,=\, \frac{V_{x,y}^2}{V_x V_y};
\,\,\,\, \hat{\sigma} \,=\, \sqrt{\frac{\mathrm{RSS}}{n - k - 1}}\,\,\,\,
\Big(n = \sum_{i=1}^k n_i\Big)</script>

<p>The $t$-test and the $F$-test for the null-hypothesis of &#8220;$\beta = 0$&#8221;
are obtained by considering the effect of $\hat{\beta}$ on the residual
sum-of-squares, measured by the decrease from $V_y$ to RSS. The
$F$-statistic is the ratio of the &#8220;explained&#8221; sum-of-squares to the
residual sum-of-squares, divided by their corresponding degrees of
freedom. There are $n\,{-}\,k$ degrees of freedom for $V_y$, parameter
$\beta$ reduces that to $n\,{-}\,k\,{-}\,1$ for RSS, and their
difference $V_y - {}$RSS has just 1 degree of freedom:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">F \,=\, \frac{(V_y - \mathrm{RSS})/1}{\mathrm{RSS}/(n\,{-}\,k\,{-}\,1)}
\,=\, \frac{\hat{R}^2\,(n\,{-}\,k\,{-}\,1)}{1-\hat{R}^2}; \quad
t \,=\, \hat{R}\, \sqrt{\frac{n\,{-}\,k\,{-}\,1}{1-\hat{R}^2}}.</script>

<p>The
$t$-statistic is simply the square root of the $F$-statistic with the
appropriate choice of sign. If the null hypothesis and the linear model
are both true, the $t$-statistic has Student $t$-distribution with
$n\,{-}\,k\,{-}\,1$ degrees of freedom. We can also compute it if we
divide $\hat{\beta}$ by its estimated standard deviation:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">st.dev(\hat{\beta})_{\mathrm{est}} \,=\, \hat{\sigma}\,/\sqrt{V_x} \quad\Longrightarrow\quad
t \,=\, \hat{R}\sqrt{V_y} \,/\, \hat{\sigma} \,=\, \beta \,/\, st.dev(\hat{\beta})_{\mathrm{est}}</script>

<p>The standard deviation estimate for $\beta$ is included in
<code>stratstats.dml</code> output.</p>
