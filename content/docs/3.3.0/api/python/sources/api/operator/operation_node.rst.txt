Operation Node
==============

  .. todo
    The explanation for overloade methods seems weird and does not really describe which
    methods we mean (magic methods for operators like `+`, `*` etc.).
    Also I don't understand why that would mean that they return an ``OpeartionNode``.

An ``OperationNode`` represents an operation that executes in SystemDS.
Most methods are overloaded for ``OperationNode``.
This means that they return an ``OperationNode``.

To get the result from an ``OperationNode`` you simply call ``.compute()`` on it, thereby getting the numpy or pandas equivalent result.

.. note::

  All operations are lazily evaluated, meaning before calling ``.compute()`` nothing will be executed in SystemDS.
  Therefore errors will not immediately be recognized while constructing an sequence of operators.

.. autoclass:: systemds.operator.OperationNode
  :members:

  .. automethod:: __init__
